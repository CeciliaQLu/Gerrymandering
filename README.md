# Gerrymandering

Run "Main.java" for Gerrymandering.

Please input an even number for the number of precincts, and number of people in each precinct,
then press “Enter”.

Then it will automatically generate a list of precincts. As required in the handout, the precincts must be divided into two districts with the same amount of precincts. Therefore, my program only accepts even number of precincts.
